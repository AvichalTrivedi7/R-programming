#  ðŸ“‚ R-Programming Repository  

This repository contains R scripts covering fundamental to advanced topics in R programming. The focus is on **data manipulation, statistical calculations, and data visualization**, which are essential for data science and analytics.  

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

### ðŸ”¹ Fundamentals of R  
- **Basic Operations & Assignment** â€“ Print statements, assignments, and operations in R  
- **Control Structures** â€“ If-else, loops (for, while), and conditional execution  
- **User-Defined Functions** â€“ Writing custom functions for reusable code  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Structures  
- **Vectors & Named Vectors** â€“ Creation, sorting, and modification  
- **Matrices** â€“ Creation, indexing, matrix operations (solve, determinant, eigenvalues)  
- **Arrays** â€“ 3D array creation and access  
- **Lists** â€“ Creation, indexing, and operations  
- **Data Frames** â€“ Creation, accessing, conditional selection, column-row operations  

### ðŸ”¹ File Handling & Data Import/Export  
- **Reading & Writing CSV Files** â€“ Handling CSVs, row names, skipping rows, setting working directories  
- **Reading & Writing Excel Files** â€“ Read/write `.xlsx` files using `writexl`, `readxl`  
- **Working with RData Files** â€“ Saving and loading `.RData` files  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Manipulation  
- **dplyr Package** â€“ Filtering, arranging, summarizing, renaming, pipe operators (`%>%`)  
- **Conditional Selection & Subsetting** â€“ Extracting specific data subsets  

### ðŸ”¹ Statistical Calculations  
- **Apply Family Functions** â€“ `apply()`, `sapply()`, `lapply()`, `tapply()` for data transformation  
- **Table & Summary Functions** â€“ Summarizing categorical and numerical data  

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Topics  
- **Package Management** â€“ Installing and using R packages  
- **Vectorized Operations** â€“ Arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators
- **Data Visualization** â€“ Plotting and Updating Various graphs from Datasets  

## ðŸš€ Usage  
To run any script, open RStudio or use the R terminal and execute:  
```r
source("filename.R")
```

## ðŸ›  Requirements  
Ensure you have **R and RStudio installed**. Some scripts require additional packages like `dplyr`, `readxl`, and `writexl`, which can be installed using:  


## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
This repository is designed to help **students, data enthusiasts, and professionals** learn and practice R programming concepts. The scripts cover:  
- Fundamental operations and data structures  
- Reading and writing different file formats (CSV, Excel, RData)  
- Data manipulation using `dplyr` and base R  
- Statistical calculations and apply family functions  
- Control structures and user-defined functions  

Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your R skills, this repository serves as a structured learning resource.
